    <p>The video shows yellow dots seemingly making random movements on a purple background. In the top left, there is a
        light blue square, and in the bottom right, there is a dark blue square. As time passes, increasingly structured
        movement becomes apparent, and by the end of the video, the dots form a bridge, swaying back and forth between
        the two squares.</p>
    <p>In the video the narrator sais: "The ants
        start at random points in their world and choose either finding food or returning home as their objective.
        During their search, they can only do two things: transmit information to others in their vicinity about when
        they last visited either of these two objectives and change direction based on the information received from
        others. In the event that an ant reaches its desired destination, it starts searching for the other target."</p>
