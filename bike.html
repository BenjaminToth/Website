                                <p>
                                    This project was based on addressing several issues faced by a delivery company. In
                                    the
                                    system of such a company, it collects restaurants that offer home delivery and
                                    provides
                                    customers with a convenient interface through which they can place orders with their
                                    chosen restaurant. The orders placed are not delivered by the restaurant's own
                                    delivery
                                    personnel; instead, the delivery company sends a delivery person to handle the
                                    delivery.
                                    Each delivery person operates under the company's colors, but the system manages
                                    different delivery personnel in different ways. It takes into account the mode of
                                    transportation used by the delivery person, with bicycles being the most common, but
                                    the
                                    company also employs delivery personnel using cars, motorcycles, and walking. Some
                                    companies even consider the quantity and quality of previously completed tasks when
                                    assigning personalized tasks to delivery personnel.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I spoke to an acquaintance who works as a bicycle delivery person for one such
                                    company
                                    and gained insight into their system and the interface that a delivery person
                                    working
                                    there sees. I learned about the approximate distances a delivery person typically
                                    travels for each address, the time the system allows for task completion, and that
                                    it's
                                    rare for delivery personnel to handle multiple orders simultaneously. It was
                                    valuable
                                    information to me that, although the system takes the delivery person's location
                                    into
                                    account, it doesn't prescribe the exact route. A delivery person only receives the
                                    two
                                    addresses: one for picking up the order and another for delivery.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This project was based on these insights. Rather than starting with an online
                                    algorithm,
                                    I worked on a task allocation problem that optimally assigns tasks to delivery
                                    personnel
                                    at a given moment. The goal was for the model to consider multiple factors beyond
                                    what
                                    delivery companies typically consider, and I aimed to visually represent an optimal
                                    solution to such a problem.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During the task, we had to solve a <strong>minimum weight perfect matching</strong>
                                    problem, implement
                                    multiple <strong>Dijkstra</strong> algorithms, and find an optimal solution to a
                                    more
                                    complex linear
                                    programming (LP) problem. And finally, we visualized the obtained results.

                                The <em>blue</em> dot represents the courier's location, the <em>red</em> dot represents

                                address, and finally, the <em>green</em> dot signifies the restaurant where the

                                was
                                placed. The <em>orange</em> line is the courier's shortest route, as you would expect.

                                Here is the depiction of a more complex scenario where multiple customers have ordered
                                from
                                various restaurants, and there are several available couriers as well:
                            </p>

                                In this picture, it's a bit more challenging to distinguish the specific routes, but
                                it's
                                clearly visible that each customer's order has been distributed among the couriers. This
                                is
                                an optimal solution for this particular situation.
